3. **Realistic Logistics**  
   Outline the practical steps, requirements, and timeline a student must follow to pursue their chosen career path, including milestones and checkpoints.

4. **Resource Recommendations**  
   Suggest relevant resources such as courses, books, online platforms, and communities to help students build the skills they need.

5. **Educational Mapping**  
   Provide information on colleges, universities, or institutions that offer the necessary programs and skills for each career pathway.

6. **Holistic Career Awareness**  
   Ensure users are aware of diverse study fields, professional opportunities, and the dedication required to reach their goals.
